<p>When you start using Enso app you might find "the peace and quiet" a bit unsettling, but after a while you will definitely appreciate the prolonged periods of focus.</p>

<p><strong>What is the Enso app?</strong><br>
<em>Notifications are great, they keep you "on top of things". There's just 1 'but'; they pop up whenever <strong>they</strong> like not whenever you find it convenient... And so they rip up your train of thought, shred your focus and kick you out of the zone.</em>
<em>The Enso app enables you to turn them off for a preset period of time in which you can enjoy uninterrupted focus on the task at hand.</em></p>

<p><strong>What are "pomodoro's"?</strong><br>
<em><a href="http://pomodorotechnique.com/">The Pomodoro TechniqueÂ®</a> is a productivity technique developed by Francesco Cirillo. It works with "Pomodoro's", 25 minute periods of concentrated work alternated with short breaks. If you want to ramp up your productivity you should definitely try it!</em></p>

<p><strong>Can Enso start when I log in?</strong><br>
<em>Sure. The easiest way is to drag the app in the dock, right click it and choose <code>Options &gt; Open at Login</code>. By the way: great that you like it so much :-)</em></p>

<p><strong>Can you please add this feature?</strong><br>
<em>You can always <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?screen_name=maarten&amp;text=Can+you+add+feature+x%3F&amp;hashtags=ensoapp,free2create">contact me</a> to let me know what you would like to see in the Enso app. It might take more than 25 minutes before I respond though...</em></p>

<p><strong>Why can't I find Enso in the App Store?</strong><br>
<em>Enso uses <strong>assistive access</strong>; you need to allow the app to control your computer. Apple does not allow apps in the App Store to control the computer of their customers.</em></p>

<a id="privacy" class="anchor" href="#privacy" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Privacy</h3>
